Our "hackers" are 25 current and recent JHU graduate students from the MS in Data Analytics and Policy, MS in Applied Economics, and MA in Government programs. Hackers are organized into five teams, each with a different substantive focus connected to our broader event theme.

## Transparency in Government

This theme explores how governments can make decisions, budgets, and performance visible in ways that feel meaningful and trustworthy to residents. It centers on closing the promise–performance gap by pairing clear reporting with honest communication about uncertainty, trade-offs, and implementation progress. It also grapples with how privacy and security feature in transparency policy. The aim is to show how transparency, when designed for comprehension and accountability, can invite engagement rather than fuel cynicism.

## Social and Economic Justice

This theme examines how institutions can reduce disparities in access, outcomes, and treatment across health, justice, education, and employment. It looks for biased processes and bottlenecks that quietly shape inequity, and considers how transparency, accountability, and community co-design can shift both performance and perception. The narrative is about building systems that not only function better but also feel fair, respectful, and responsive to those they serve.

## Democracy and Misinformation

The focus here is on safeguarding civic participation by improving information integrity and voter understanding amid polarized media and digital manipulation. It considers interventions like source labeling, content provenance, bot detection, and neutral issue summaries, aiming to increase knowledge without overwhelming or biasing users. The broader arc is a democratic ecosystem where rules are clear, data privacy is respected, and citizens can make informed choices with confidence.
